# Rock Paper Scissors Game Documentation

Introduction:

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of a Rock Paper Scissors game developed using vanilla JavaScript for logic and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Project Overview:

The Rock Paper Scissors game allows two players to compete against each other. Each player selects one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the choices made by the players according to the traditional rules of the game.

Project Structure:

1. index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the game interface. It includes elements for displaying player options, result messages, and game controls.
2. style.css: This file contains minimal custom CSS for the game layout and responsiveness. Tailwind CSS classes are used extensively for styling.
3. game.js: This JavaScript file contains the game logic and functionality. It handles user interactions, processes player choices, determines the winner, and updates the UI accordingly.

Installation and Usage:

To run the Rock Paper Scissors game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the project files directly.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Start playing the game by selecting your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the result displayed on the screen.

Game Logic:

The game logic is implemented in game.js using JavaScript. Here's a high-level overview of the logic:

1. Define variables to store player choices, result messages, and game controls.
2. Add event listeners to handle user clicks on player options.
3. Implement a function to generate a random choice for the computer opponent.
4. Write a function to determine the winner based on the choices made by both players.
5. Update the UI to display the result message and reset the game after each round.

Tailwind CSS Integration:

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the game interface. It provides utility classes for layout, typography and component styling.

Conclusion:

The Rock Paper Scissors game project demonstrates the use of vanilla JavaScript for implementing game logic and Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides an engaging and interactive experience for players to enjoy the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors.
